# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 6th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the grind, set up git on windows. Did a leet code problem. Shouted out people on twitter

**Thoughts**: The roman numeral problem was interesting. Made a cool skip flag for checking the compound values. Hashmaps rule.

**Link(s) to work**: [Leet code roman numerals to integers](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/267481174/)

### Day 1: October 7th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: picked an interesting problem with a lowish accepted rate

**Thoughts**: Not as challenging as I first believed. Ended up being a relatively simple iterative solution. Created a list I didn't end up using. Oops.

### Day 2: October 8th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: completed the find a substring within a string problem without using str.includes()


### Day 3: October 9th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the longestCommonPrefix problem on leet code

**Thoughts**: I realized this could be done by looping through the words and the letters and breaking the loop when we see any letter is different. I realize now I actually want the length of the shortest word because then I won't need an exception handler for list index out of range

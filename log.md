# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 6th, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Joined the grind, set up git on windows. Did a leet code problem. Shouted out people on twitter

**Thoughts**: The roman numeral problem was interesting. Made a cool skip flag for checking the compound values. Hashmaps rule.
